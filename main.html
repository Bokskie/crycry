        <h2><i>Start of our Story</i></h2>
        
         <p>I can't forget everything 
            I found him in mobile legend and I met him<bR>
            This is what happens.<br>
            I'm bored with my main acc <bR>
            I created a Smurf account to beat up weak players<bR>
            I used to play solo 10 games<bR>
            It's fun because it's easy to win in a low-rank<bR>
            After I reached 20 games I'm no longer happy because I'm bored<bR>
            I was looking for my party mate back then in the world chat on ml<bR>
            I started looking for maybe that afternoon<bR>
            I've talked to a lot of girls before but I don't trip to chat with girls<bR>
            11 pm i looked at the world chat on ml<bR>
            I saw Daddy's Girl<bR>
            I hurried to chat with him then and then I said "HI!" to him<bR>
            I don't expect him to reply to me<bR>
            And she follows my account and I follow back<br>
            That's where our conversation started I made the topic <bR>
            I asked her name age and what her name Daddy's Girl means <bR>
            He told me because he said he was papas girls so daddy's girl<bR>
            Maybe about 30mins we also talked that we were done about 12 <bR>
            Because he was already asleep<bR>
            After that the next day we didn't use to chat<bR>
            I played with other girls<bR>
                <br>

             <i><h2> After 1 month <br>
            This is where we start playing
             </h2></i><br>

            <p> After a month of playing with girls <br>
            I was surprised because Daddy's girl invited me to play duo<br>
            I accepted and we played<br>
            After 1 game of playing<br>
            He said he was a hangover<br>
            I know and I found out that he was drinking<br>
            That's what I don't like most about women<br>
            But I believed that someday he choose to change her personality for her love <br>
            I hope he understands what I mean <bR>
            He used to invite me all the time<br>
            We were playing but no chat happened<br>
            I was amazed because every time we would play<br>
            He trash-talked the opponents<br>
            I liked him there because of<br>
            He's a bit rude to play<br>
            For me, he was cool when I met him because he was a trashtalker<br>
            Until we were always playing<br>
            I'm not sure who was the first to chat with us then<br>
            And that's when we chatted but at that time I didn't know his language<br>
            So we used to talk Tagalog <br>
            Until it was found out that he was from Cebu<br>
            I told her if she knows how to speak Visayas cause I think she is Cebuana<br>
            Then he replies "Ambot lang"<br>
            Then I laugh because his type of woman wants me to like him<br>
            And I also reply in the lobby chat "buang" cause he says "ambot lang"<br>
            And he reply "Ikaw ra buang" and I started laughing again<br>
            I'm glad because our language is the same<br>
            I think it will be easier for us to talk if we use our real language  <br>  
            We played again<br>  
            in we always play and we are both trashtalker<br>  
            The other random players we met had open mics<br>  
            And we hear them talking<br>  
            And they told us that we are jowa and we laugh on the chat box<br>  
            Maybe they said that because of us playing so annoying<br>  
            Just trash talk per game<br>  
            Daddy's girl and I had the same vibes when we played  <br>  
        </p><br>
          
        <i><h2>The day came when 
            I was jealous</i></h2><br>          

         <p>After a few days I found out that Daddy's girl <br>
            Has a lot of boyfriends or maybe flirting with other guys<br>
            Because I always see him playing unusual with him<br>
            Cause he always invited me to play when I'm online <br>
            But that time she is so busy playing with other guys <br>
            So I don't have the right to stop what he doing <br>
            The cause was not in a relationship but maybe a duo only<br>
            I started feeling doubt about her<br>
            I check her history and I saw that he had another duo <br>
            Then I feel jealous of that <br>
            I'm restless I want to know who his dou<br>
            I'd started searching for his duo to know what their relations <br>
            And there's a guy that Daddy's girl is within the game <br>
            Because he gave her a gift just buying diamonds<br>
            We use the same language<br>
            Daddy's girl invited me with her duo<br>
            And then he spoke there in the chat box ingame<br>
            And he said something that hurt me<br>
            The word he say is "Pag storya mung duha kay inyu ko gaawayan or ilugan"<br>
            It really means that he's not serious with me<br>
            I realize that it's been a month since we played together<br>
            I don't seem to take advantage of our constant togetherness<br>
            The man he talked to me then was very rude<br>
            He said what is the relationship with Daddy's girl<br>
            I said we don't have a relationship, he's just my duo<br>
            He said rude words that the woman didn't like<br>
            He insulted Daddy's girl but I didn't say anything<br>
            Until now I still keep it a secret<br>
            So I wondered why Daddy's girl wanted<br>
            Men love sex chats and say sexual words or bad words<br>
            Because of what happened, I was hurt when I found out<br>
            He even preferred to play and chat with that rude guy<br>
            I was offline for 2 days, I had no plans to go back to ml<br>
            But I accidentally click my ml app while cleaning my house<br>
            And I read his chat<br>
            And he said that he left the guy and that he would choose to be with me<br>
                
            </p>
      

               
        <i><h2>BACK TO NORMAL</i></h2><br>   

        <p>We are back to normal, we are playing again<br>
            But he still has other male/boys playmates <br>
            But I just ignore it<br>
            Until we came together still in September <br>
            Daddy's girl decides to make a smurf<br>
            And he named it Erika?<br>
            And I asked her if her real name was Erika <br>
            And the answer is yes Erika is her real name<br>
            I also made mine to accompany him to rank up<br>
            We chat every day<br>
            Always lsm (long sweet message)<br>
            Even though I'm cleaning the house, my cellphone is turned on <br>
            So I can replay him right away when he messages<br>
            We always talk and we share what we did today like we update each other<br>
            Erika doesn't tell the truth to herself<br>
            That was the first thing I liked about him<br>
            Because it's right he shouldn't trust me right away<br>
            Because we don't know each other yet<br>
            Erika never told me about her social media<br>
            Like FB or Instagram but I also have no intention of asking him<br>
            Better if I wait for him to give<br>
            Because I don't want him to think I'm rushing him<br>
            Maybe this is the time when I feel I'm so in love <br>
            My heart is so heavy and complicated at that time<br>
            This is the time I overthink him<br>
            He never left my mind even though I took an online class <br>
            That he distracted me from my mind<br>
            When I wake up in the morning,<br>
            I look for my phone to go online immediately <br>
            And see if he messages me with "GOOD MORNING"<br>
            When I saw if he texted me good morning<br>
            I'm very happy because he was great to me in the morning<br>
            </p><br>

            <i><h2>MEMORABLE SEPTEMBER IN MY LIFE</i></h2><br>   


            <p>The month of September is the one I will never forget<br>
            Because this is "FIRST TIME I CRY"<br>
            The reason is that Erika has been offline for 1 and a half days <br>
            And I have no clue<br>
            And I couldn't handle that, I was very depressed on September 29 to 30<br>
            Because Erika is not online on that day<br>
            I cried in my room<br>
            I waited for 10 hours, I didn't turn off my cellphone<br>
            My mom came into my room and saw me crying<br>
            But not crying when he saw me, <br>
            He saw my eyes red and there were tears in my eyes and he knows I'm crying that time<br>
            But I didn't tell him the reason why I'm crying<br>
            Because he hasn't seen me cry like that, especially when I'm older<br>
            I'm waiting for Erika to go online <Br>
            I always look at my friend list if his name is online <Br>
            I cried a lot that night <BR>
            I can't go out of my room even outside the house<bR>
            And tomorrow September 30<bR>
            I still waited like I did yesterday<bR>
            And he finally went online at 4 pm <bR>
            I cried a lot and I was very happy because he came back(tears of joy)<bR>
            And this is what he told me after he returned<bR>
            Huhuhu I'm really happy because he's online I can't stop I'm crying<bR><br>
         

        </p>       


        <i><h2>THE DAY I REALIZED THAT I'M FALLING IN LOVE</i></h2><br>  
       
        <p>
            We started playing again<br> 
            And then we started letting each other know what we were going to do<br> 
            Similar to going out of the house with friends outside and drinking<br> 
            Sometimes I tell him he won't drink anymore<br> 
            Because I don't like women who drink<br> 
            But he was so stubborn he would not listen<br> 
            Sometimes I get disappointed <br> 
            Sometimes I lose chances to be us in the future<br> 
            I always tell her that the man she chooses <br> 
            Is kind and will love you very much and the man has a good job<br> 
            She can marry in the future<br> 
            Maybe I thought of those things<br> 
            Because I would like her life to be good in the future <br> 
            Because I love this girl<br>
            All the things we want are compatible<br>
            Both in color and in food and music<br>
            We both like it <br>
            Until the month of November came the day of the dead (hallowen) <br> 
            And we told wonderful stories about ghosts or something connected to Halloween story<br> 
            We shared our stories and we rate the story how good the story was<br> 
            For me, that memory is very fun<br> 
            The first time I have hallowen story chat<br> 
            Very fun that day as it takes me more to in love with him<br> 
            Sometimes we planned to change our call sign<br>
            Because I'm jealous of the number of men you chat with<br>
            But you said don't because you love me <br>
            so let's just call love so our call sign is still in the same <br>
            Sometimes when I have a duo, he acts jealous<br>
            But the truth is I don't know because his mind can't really be read<br>
            Because Erika tends to play with people<br>
            So you can't say what he said is true<br>
            I always doubted him<br><br>


        </p>

        <i><h2>REVELATIONS </i></h2><br>  

        <p>
            Erika said that she is 17 and will have her birthday next year<br>
            But he did not immediately say the date<br>
            Maybe because he doesn't trust me<br>
            Erika wants to admit something about me<br>
            And he said he had a heart disease<br>
            I didn't believe it at first<br>
            I thought so much because of his illness<br>
            He told me if I would still accept him even if he had a heart disease<br>
            And I answered “YES” because your heart disease is not a barrier to our love<br>
            I will accept you even if you are seriously ill<br>
            I'm not the man who just because of heart disease, <br>
            I don't like you anymore<br>
            Maybe the other guys are like that <br>
            But I'm different so I always tell you not to compare me to others<br>
            Erika also told of her mother's death<br>
            I can't go there because it's private<br>
            Maybe because of what he said I was very happy<br>
            For a long time, she trusted me and shared <br>
            Her personal background information of her family and especially to herself<br>

        </p>

         <i><h2>DISASTER</i></h2><br>  

        <p> There was a storm in December near Christmas <br>
            And lost signal and Visayas and Mindanao <br>
            I watched the news on tv and I saw it in Cebu <br>
            Massive damage was inflicted on Cebu they had the center of the typhoon<br>
            I'm worried about what happened to Erika if she's okay<br>
           3days after before the signals back, but it was still unstable<br>
            But after 5 days he went online, he said he was using wifi with his friend<br>
            And he just told the story of what happened in their place<br>
            I'm happy because he's ok<br>
            After that, we just enjoy happy CHRISTMAS and NEWYEAR<br>
            But he said he had a heart attack on Dec 27. <br>
            I'm not sure but what he said<br>
            He didn't immediately tell me I was really worried about him<br>
            I almost cried then but he said he was ok<br>
        
        </p><br>


        <i><h2>JANUARY TO FEBRUARY</i></h2><br>  

        <p>
            It's the new year and it's almost January 6<br>
            On January 4 they went Erika to the hotel<br>
            Since his sister's birthday<br>
            When my birthday is on January 6<br>
            I regret<br>
            Because I wasn't online for my birthday<br>
            I didn't think of Erika because I was preparing for the day <br>
            When my friends would come to my house that day<br>
            He's mad at me because I'm not online<br>
            Maybe he was worried about me<br>
            And on his birthday on February 7<br>
            He was online<br>
            I thought he would enjoy himself with his fam and friends<br>
            But he still chose to go online to ml and chat<br>
            I didn't sleep on February 6, I looked forward to midnight/12pm on February 7 and<br>
            I started great with happy birthday and messages on her birthday<br>
            I gave him a great happy birthday and gave him nice messages<br>
            I remember he album images in ml, then he took a screenshot of our chat<br>
            And we had a dating chat on valentines<br>
            Nag advance happy valentines nako 1am palang<br>
            We're still fighting a bit now<br>
            Then he texted me Happy valentines<br>

        </p><br>

        <i><h2>THE WORST THAT HAPPENED TO THE TWO OF US</i></h2><br>  

        <p>End of February and March<br>
            We always fight that month<br>
            Because of jealousy or misunderstanding<br>
            Or maybe I always doubt<br>
            Cause she type a girl who always wants to chat with other men<br>
            Until it got to the point where we no longer felt like chatting with each other<br>
            The height of our pride<br>
            There is no humility in us<br>
            Maybe we haven't chatted for 5 days<br>
            We were just playing with ourselves<br>
            Then that night<br>
            Chatted with me he said "HI"<br>
            "Mingaw manko nimo oy kung wala ko mingaw di taka chatan ba"<br>
            And then he seems weird to chat<br>
            Felt as if he was drunk<br>
            And he told me that he had been drunk for 5 days<br>
            I didn't know why he always use to drunk<br>
            Because he always says "Promise di nako mag inom, Stop nako ana"<br>
            Came the point thought of whether to lower pride<br>
            I'll just take care of him<br>
            I always understood him in anything<br>
            Then I was in school then<br>
            I read his message that he hacked his acc<br>
            At first, I didn't want to believe it because it was just my acc that he unfollowed<br>
            Then I try to retrieve his acc<br>
            But not really<br>
            That's why I didn't force him<br>
            He made a new acc then he named iring.!.<br>
            I'm happy because he named the nickname I give him<br>
            So think about how much I love you<br>
            I accompany you in all things<br>
            I want to give all my time to you<br>


        </p><br>

        <i><h2>HAPPY ALMOST 1 YEAR OF RELATIONSHIP</i></h2><br>  
        <p>I'm happy because he never left me<br>
           I always tease him that he won't leave me HAHAHA<br>
           then after now, we are still talking happily<br>
           I didn't expect that we would be in ml for one year<br>
           I think that maybe we can talk only in ml<br>
           I'm just really waiting for him to give his "you know" what I mean<br>
           But I didn't think of that<br>
           I told him how long I would have to wait<br>
           It's ok with me even if it's a few years or it's took a long<br>
           He said (2) I knew right away what 2 meant<br>
           He also said that he was 16 and not 18<br>
           I was surprised there<br>
           Because we've been together for a year but I was fooled<br>
           I believe that he has been 18 for 1 year<br>
           So I will never really lose my doubts about him<br>
           I always doubted because he didn't tell the truth<br>
           As for me, I don't know him yet<br>
           Even his face was not seen<br>
           But I do not regret that I met him<br>
           I am so happy because I met this woman that you are happy to talk to<br>
           Just the same vibes and we understand each other in everything<br>
        </p><br>
